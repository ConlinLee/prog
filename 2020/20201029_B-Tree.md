#### Origin
In computer science, a B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. The B-tree generalizes the binary search tree, allowing for nodes with more than two children. here 

#### Definiation

According to Knuth's definition, a B-tree of order m is a tree which satisfies the following properties:

Every node has at most m children.
Every non-leaf node (except root) has at least ⌈m/2⌉ child nodes.
The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node.
A non-leaf node with k children contains k − 1 keys.
All leaves appear in the same level and carry no information.

####  The order m
the maximum number of the children, so the maximum number of keys is m - 1.
Each internal node's keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees.

#### Internal nodes

Every internal node contains a maximum of U children and a minimum of L children.
Thus, the number of elements is always 1 less than the number of child pointers (the number of elements is between L−1 and U−1). 
U must be either 2L or 2L−1; therefore each internal node is at least half full. 
The relationship between U and L implies that two half-full nodes can be joined to make a legal node

#### 
B-trees keep values in every node in the tree except leaf nodes.

#### why we need B-tree
the depth of binary tree is too big for storage usage
