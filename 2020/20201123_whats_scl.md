#### background

Your GCC is too old. Please run following command to add DTS to your environment:
```
scl enable devtoolset-8 bash
```
Or add following line to the end of ~/.bashrc to add it permanently:
```
source scl_source enable devtoolset-8
```

#### so what is scl

When developing applications for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), developers have two major toolchains to choose from:

1. There is a set of tools (known as base tools) delivered within RHEL which includes Python, GCC, PHP, Ruby, Perl, and much more. These tools have the same support life cycle as RHEL - up to ten years. To maintain compatibility, the major versions of these tools are fixed at the time of the "dot-zero" release of RHEL. If you want a toolchain thatâ€™s supported for 10 years, then use these.

1. Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) are for developers looking for continually updated tools such as the latest stable versions of dynamic languages, open source databases, web infrastructure, and other essential development tools.

#### advantages
RHSCL releases occur semi-annually. Packages built as a software collection do not overwrite the versions (base tools) included with RHEL.
