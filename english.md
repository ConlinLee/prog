#### acquire
the scheduling policy shall determine which thread shall acquire the mutex.

#### aptly
UNIX guru W. Richard Stevens aptly describes signals as software interrupts.

#### audit
SUDO gives an audit trail I believe under /var/log/secure.

#### argument
argument (ref: man shutdown)

#### authentication

#### authority

#### as if
If  a signal is delivered to a thread waiting for a mutex,
upon return from the signal handler the thread shall resume waiting for the mutex as if it was not interrupted.

#### below
The 'gdb' script provided below can be modified as fits.

#### care
Making a thread detached is useful for some types of daemon threads whose exit status the application does not need to care  about.

#### crude

#### coin (=create)
The term trie was coined two years later by Edward Fredkin

#### collapse
collapse all

#### consult
consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior

#### contrast
in contrast to 0, which gets you to the beginning, regardless of whitespace or not.

#### default
By default, on RedHat based distributions like CentOS and Fedora.

#### differ
The Linux implementation of this interface may differ.

#### determine
the scheduling policy shall determine which thread shall acquire the mutex.

#### detection
If the mutex type is PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL, deadlock detection shall not be provided.
 
#### demonstrate
The program below demonstrates the use of pthread_create(), as well as a number of other functions in the pthreads API.

#### dependent
Signal all dependent instructions that data is ready.

#### divert
if we divert the second write to an alternate storage location.

#### eliminate
Can we eliminate such dependencies?

#### equivalent
This is equivalent to calling pthread_exit(3) with the value

#### expand all

#### fairly
There was some fairly strong pushback against the mutex patch after last week's article was written.

#### heuristic

#### hang

#### idempotent
In other words, signal delivery is idempotent.

#### indeterminate
it is indeterminate which thread—the caller or the new thread—will next execute.

#### incredibly 
it is simply incredibly broken.

#### IIRC
if I remember correctly

#### login
logged-in users (ref: man shutdown)   

#### mastery
#### meant
Note that these instructions are meant for developers who are compiling the code for development and testing.

#### maintain
If the mutex type is PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE, then the mutex shall maintain the concept of a lock count.

#### number
nproc - print the number of processing units available.
sched_getcpu() returns the number of the CPU on which the calling thread is currently executing.

#### order
it  is not possible to join with the thread in order to obtain its exit status. 

#### obtain
it  is not possible to join with the thread in order to obtain its exit status. 

#### point
The discussion did not stop at that point。

#### possible
it  is not possible to join with the thread in order to obtain its exit status. 

#### redundant

#### refine
Ingo has continued to refine this patch set, with frequent releases;

#### result in
If  the mutex type is PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT, attempting to recursively lock the mutex results in undefined behavior. 

#### relinquish

#### respect

#### redundant

#### speculation
value speculation.

#### scheme
out-of-order general scheme.

#### trail
SUDO gives an audit trail I believe under /var/log/secure.

#### unless
Unless real-time scheduling  policies  are  being employed.
 
#### vertex

#### violation
This is in violation of the POSIX threads specification

#### wall
wall message: the mssage sent by command wall
