Robust programs are able to handle error conditions gracefully. They are programs that do not crash no matter what the user does.
Building robust programs is essential to the practice of programming. Writing robust programs takes discipline and work - it usually
entails finding every possible problem that can occur, and coming up with an action plan for your program to take.

Programmers get so focused on simply solving the problem at hand that they fail to look at the possible side issues.

about making sure your program works, it’s about making sure your program doesn’t break.

Depending on your program, this may include ending the program, prompting the user to re-enter values, notifying a central error log, rolling back an operation, or ignoring it and continuing.
