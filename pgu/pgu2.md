#### Entering in the Program

These programs may overwhelm you at first. However, go through them with diligence.

Please tinker around with the programs as much as you can.

Assembling is the process that transforms what you typed into instructions for the machine.

The linker is the program that is responsible for putting the object files together and adding
information to it so that the kernel knows how to load and run it.

What is happening is that every program when it exits gives Linux an
exit status code, which tells it if everything went all right.

UNIX programs return numbers other than zero to indicate failure or
other errors, warnings, or statuses.
